  <p>
    Welcome to the Ouroboros Project!
  </p>
  <p>
  In this project we envision and develop a software system which integrates a
  compiled programming language (<span class="mono">C++</span>) with many
  scripting languages (<span class="mono">Lua</span> and <span class="mono">Python</span>).
  The objetive here is to make it easier for programmers to export native routines
  from <span class="mono">C++</span> to these scripting languages, aswell as to embed
  scripts onto his or hers application.
